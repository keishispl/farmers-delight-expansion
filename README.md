## Overview

**Farmer's Delight Expansion** is a mod made to add new foodstuffs, plants and quality of life changes to the Farmer's Delight mod and Minecraft itself.

**NOTICE!** The mod will rarely be updated, as life has been busy for me.

## Features
* Achievements relating to Farmer's Delight & This Mod
* Better Crop Drops (e.g. Apple, Rice)
* Fruits, Juices, Foods & Sweets
* Eggs stack all the way to 64

Like Apples, you can find oranges in birch leaves, grapes and blueberries in spruce leaves (you can replant them like berry bushes).
